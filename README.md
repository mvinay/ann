# Artifical Neural Network Implementation

A simple Artificial Neural network that learns using the back-propagation algorithm. Network can contain any number of hidden layers and any number of neurons in each layer. Check the main function in the file for the usage. Sigmoid function is used as the activation function. But, it can be changed to anything by chaning the sigmoid() and derivative() functions.
